# End-to-end-tomato-diseases-classification-by-Tensorflow
The dataset is about the tomato disease and this code uses Tensorflow, Keras framework to apply image classification from scratch
- I also upload the tomato dataset in tag, so you can also download it and apply the code following
- The dataset is a little bit imbalanced (If  you want to fix it, you can umsampling it though)
